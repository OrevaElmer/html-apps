            Delta State is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Named after the Niger Delta[4]—a large part of which is in the state—the state was formed from the former Bendel State on August 27, 1991. Bordered on the north by Edo State, the east by Anambra and Rivers States, and the south by Bayelsa State while to the west is the Bight of Benin which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline.[5] The State was initially created with 12 local government areas[6] in 1991 which was later extended to 19 and now has 25 local government areas. Asaba as its state capital is located along the River Niger on the northeastern end of the State, while the state's economic centre is Warri on the southwestern coastline.

            The State covers a landmass of about 18,050 km2 (6,970 sq mi), of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between 5°00' and 6°45' E and 5°00' and 6°30' N.[16] It is geographically located in Nigeria's Midwest, bounded in the north and west by Edo State, the east by Anambra, Imo, and Rivers States, southeast by Bayelsa State,[17] and on the southern extreme is the Bight of Benin which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without any remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-laced with rivulets and streams, which form part of the Niger Delta.[18][19][20]

            Delta State is predominantly inhabited by the Urhobo, Ukwani, Isoko, Ijaw, Ika, Aniocha-Oshimili[citation needed](Igbo), Itsekiri and the Olukumi people.[22] The population of other groups in the state are negligible.
The Urhobo-Isoko are the most predominant people inhabiting the state[22] and currently about 2.6 million spanning across 10 local government areas, followed by the Igbo people of Delta State with a population of about 1.8 million spanning across 9 Local government areas, they are sometimes referred to as the Anioma people which means (Good land in Igbo language).[25] [26][22] The Itsekiri speak a language very closely related to Yoruba but have been culturally influenced by the Edo from neighbouring Edo state, as well as the Urhobo, and Ijaw.[22] The Ijaws are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State,[27] while the Olukumi are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct,[28] due to acculturation and assimilation.[citation needed]

The vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing traditional religions.[25]
